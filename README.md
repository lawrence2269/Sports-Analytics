Mathematical model approach for draft picking in basketball
### Project Description <br>
<p>
Consider that I am having a basketball team and want to select some good players for my team. I would like to perform the following;

<br>

* <b>Machine Learning Model 1:</b> Classifying the players who will be staying with the league for more than 5 years or less than that. <br>
* <b>Machine Learning Model 2:</b> Considering the players who are good as input, will be predicting their position in the basketball court. <br>
* <b>Machine Learning Model 3:</b> Based on the above outputs, this model will group the players as good and worst contract to make the manager's job at ease<br>
</p>

### Data

Data for the above mentioned machine learning models are being collected from the following sites;

* https://data.world/
* https://www.basketball-reference.com/
* and etc.

The collected data undergoes the following data preparation steps such as cleaning, standardization, missing value imputation and concluding with model building.
